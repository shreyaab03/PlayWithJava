# PlayWithJava
This repository is my playground for learning Java. It contains various projects, from simple games to coding experiments, as I dive into Java programming. I’m sharing my progress here—not as a teaching resource, but as a way to document my journey and maybe inspire others who are also learning. Contributions and feedback are welcome, but the primary goal is my personal learning and growth.
